# Development Prompts & Summary

## Session Overview
This document tracks all prompts and their results during the development of the user-service API with Clean Architecture in Go Fiber.

---

## Prompt 1: Create Folder Structure
**Request:** From dao folder create folder in all handler, repo, service

**Result:** 
- Created folder structure based on DAO entities (users, departments, employees)
- Generated folders in:
  - `internal/handler/` (users, departments, employees)
  - `internal/repository/` (users, departments, employees)
  - `internal/service/` (users, departments, employees)

---

## Prompt 2: Create Interface Files
**Request:** In each folder that just created, create interface file

**Result:**
- Created `interface.go` in all 9 folders
- Defined interface types:
  - Handler: `IUserHandler`, `IDepartmentHandler`, `IEmployeeHandler`
  - Repository: `IUserRepository`, `IDepartmentRepository`, `IEmployeeRepository`
  - Service: `IUserService`, `IDepartmentService`, `IEmployeeService`

---

## Prompt 3: Create Entry Files
**Request:** In each folder that just created, create entry file

**Result:**
- Created implementation files with constructor functions:
  - `handler.go`, `repository.go`, `service.go` for each domain
  - Each with `New<Domain><Layer>()` constructor returning interface

---

## Prompt 4: Rename Entry Files
**Request:** Rename entry files (implementation files) in each of the folders that were just created to `<theirfoldername>_<layer>`

**Result:**
- Renamed files following pattern:
  - `handler.go` → `departments_handler.go`, `employees_handler.go`, `users_handler.go`
  - `repository.go` → `departments_repository.go`, `employees_repository.go`, `users_repository.go`
  - `service.go` → `departments_service.go`, `employees_service.go`, `users_service.go`

---

## Prompt 5: Update Naming Convention
**Request:** In each folders that created each layers, create entry file rename interface, implement struct and implement New<> to this structure:
- Interface → `I<dao name><layer>` (e.g., `IUserRepository`)
- Implement struct → `<dao name><layer>` (e.g., `UserRepository`)
- Implement function → `New<dao name><layer>` (e.g., `NewUserRepository`)
- In all repository implement struct has value `Database *gorm.DB`
- In all repository function receiving `dbconn *gorm.DB` and return struct that assign dbconn to Database

**Result:**
- Updated all interfaces with `I` prefix
- Updated all struct names (PascalCase)
- Updated all constructor functions
- Added `Database *gorm.DB` field to all repositories
- Repository constructors accept `dbconn *gorm.DB` parameter

---

## Prompt 6: Router Placement Discussion
**Request:** Where router file should be placed?

**Result:**
- Discussed two approaches for router placement
- Recommended: Dedicated `internal/routes/` package (separation of concerns)
- Alternative: Routes near handlers
- Explained advantages of centralized routing

---

## Prompt 7: Create Router with DI
**Request:** In di folder fiber app and fiber route is ready. Now please help me create each router and inject fiber router to them.

**Result:**
- Created router files in `internal/router/`:
  - `user_router.go`
  - `department_router.go`
  - `employee_router.go`
- Each router has `Setup<Domain>Routes()` function
- Receives `fiber.Router` and corresponding handler interface
- Integrated with DI container's `SetupRoutes()` method

---

## Prompt 8: Senior Engineer Consultation
**Request:** From now on act as a super senior software engineer who expert in go fiber clean architecture and software development. In di folder, I want to inject db connection to repository, I want to inject repo to service and inject service to handler. Should I sum up in di folder or distribute injecting?

**Result:**
- Recommended centralized DI in container
- Explained dependency flow: DB → Repository → Service → Handler
- Showed proper DI container structure
- Emphasized Dependency Inversion Principle
- Demonstrated interface-based injection

---

## Prompt 9: Inject withTimeout Function
**Request:** I want to inject withTimeout to repo

**Result:**
- Updated `Container` struct with `withTimeout()` method
- Modified all repository structs to include `withTimeout func() (context.Context, context.CancelFunc)`
- Updated repository constructors to accept `withTimeout` parameter
- Container now passes `c.withTimeout` to all repository constructors
- All repositories can now use timeout context for database operations

---

## Prompt 10: File Organization Discussion
**Request:** In all layers is it good to create folder to separate logic from entry point.

**Result:**
- Discussed best practices for file organization
- Recommended multiple files approach for better maintainability:
  - Entry point file (constructor)
  - Separate operation files (create, read, update, delete)
  - OR operations subfolder
- Explained benefits:
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Better Git collaboration
  - Easier code review
  - Improved testability

---

## Prompt 11: Generate Complete CRUD
**Request:** Create operation folder in all layer for all dao and generate CRUD end-to-end code pls.

**Result:**
- Attempted to create `operations/` folders in all layers
- Created CRUD structure for users, departments, employees
- User undid changes (multiple times)

---

## Prompt 12: Generate User CRUD (Final Approach)
**Request:** Generate user CRUD with specific naming:
- C → `Create<dao name>`
- R → `GetAll<dao name>`, `Get<dao name>ByID`
- U → `Update<dao name>`
- D → `Delete<dao name>`

Create operation func in new file like in `D:\Flow\New api\user-service\internal\repository\users\users.go`
Keep the CreateUser structure, do not separate file for each CRUD just write in that file.

**Result:**
✅ **Repository Layer - All 3 DAOs:**
- Created/Updated files:
  - `users/users.go` - All CRUD operations
  - `users/usermodel/user.go` - CreateUser, UpdateUser models
  - `departments/departments.go` - All CRUD operations
  - `departments/departmentmodel/department.go` - CreateDepartment, UpdateDepartment models
  - `employees/employees.go` - All CRUD operations
  - `employees/employeemodel/employee.go` - CreateEmployee, UpdateEmployee models
- Updated all interfaces with CRUD method signatures
- All operations use `withTimeout()` context
- Consistent error handling with GORM

---

## Prompt 13: Generate Service, Handler, Router Layers
**Request:** Now generate the two layer left and router following previous procedure.

**Result:**
✅ **Service Layer - All 3 DAOs:**
- Created service operation files:
  - `users/users.go` - Business logic with validation
  - `users/usermodel/user.go` - Request/Response models
  - `departments/departments.go` - Business logic with validation
  - `departments/departmentmodel/department.go` - Request/Response models
  - `employees/employees.go` - Business logic with validation
  - `employees/employeemodel/employee.go` - Request/Response models
- Features:
  - UUID auto-generation
  - Validation logic
  - Model mapping (repo models ↔ service models)
  - Error handling

✅ **Handler Layer - All 3 DAOs:**
- Created handler files:
  - `users/users.go` - HTTP handlers
  - `departments/departments.go` - HTTP handlers
  - `employees/employees.go` - HTTP handlers
- Features:
  - Request body parsing
  - HTTP status codes
  - JSON responses
  - Error handling

✅ **Router Layer - All 3 DAOs:**
- Updated router files:
  - `user_router.go` - User routes
  - `department_router.go` - Department routes
  - `employee_router.go` - Employee routes
- All CRUD endpoints configured

---

## Prompt 14: Fix GetAllEmployee API
**Request:** Fix GetAllEmployee api

**Result:**
✅ **Fixed Employee GetAll API:**
- Issue: Repository was returning joined data (`employeemodel.Employee`) but service expected domain model
- Solution:
  - Updated `EmployeeResponse` to include joined fields: `FirstName`, `Lastname`, `Department`
  - Created `EmployeeDetailResponse` for GetByID (basic employee data)
  - Fixed mapping in `GetAllEmployee()` service method
  - Updated interface signatures
  - Removed unused imports
- GetAllEmployee now returns enriched employee data with user info and department name
